// This struct is created to set the hours of operation by day of the week. I've set this up as a dictionary containting the day for the key and a tupel value of Doubles for the hours of operation. The doubles will be set to the actual open and close times of the business on that day in a 24 hr format (i.e., 23.00 = 11:00pm). A conversion will happen afterwards to make it more readable. 0.0 - 0.0 will be translated to "Closed all day"

// There are other options for the time, such as just making them strings (i.e., "12:00pm", "11:30pm"). Not sure if this is easier/cleaner or not but we should talk about it.
